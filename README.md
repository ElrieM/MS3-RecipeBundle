### Typography

- When selecting a font for the puzzle, I searched Google Fonts (filtering for Numerals) for a font with . I selected EB Garamond, which is a classical font with numbers that are equal in size and align with all other numbers in a single line. This was important to me to make sure the numbers in the puzzle appeared in a straight line across the grid, with no numbers dipping below or sticking out above others.

- For the website text, I used EB Garamond's suggested pairing "Raleway" for its elegant and classic format, which I feel alings with the nature of the game.

### Imagery

- I opted for a simple background on the because the puzzle grid is already quite busy and a busy background would add unnecessary distraction.
